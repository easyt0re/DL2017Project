# DL2017Project
This is an initial repo for Deep Learning Project.
This is a Tensorflow Implementation of https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org
To do things a bit differently, we would like to take a GoogLeNet (Inception v3) and do this.
There is also a Tensorflow implementation here: https://github.com/shekkizh/FCN.tensorflow
This project would mostly based on these previous work.

# Edit this on Github Directly is WRONG!

Here is the presentation given by the authors of the original paper.
http://techtalks.tv/talks/fully-convolutional-networks-for-semantic-segmentation/61606/

Notes from this presentation
Step 1: reinterpret fully connected layer as conv layers with 1x1 output. (No weight changing)
Step 2: add conv layer at the very end to do upsample.
Step 3: put a pixelwise loss in the end
along the way we have stack of features.
closer to the input - higher resolution - shallow, local - where
closer to the output - lower resolution - deep, global - what
Step 4: skip to fuse layers. interpolate and sum.
Step 5: Fine tune on per-pixel dataset, PASCAL
I stopped at 8:30 in the video

This is about CONVERT fully connected layer to convolutional layer:
