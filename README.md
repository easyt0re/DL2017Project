# DL2017Project
This is an initial repo for Deep Learning Project.
This is a Tensorflow Implementation of https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org
To do things a bit differently, we would like to take a GoogLeNet (Inception v3) and do this.
There is also a Tensorflow implementation here: https://github.com/shekkizh/FCN.tensorflow
This project would mostly based on these previous work.

# edit this on Github Directly is WRONG!

This is about CONVERT fully connected layer to convolutional layer:

Some links about previous people asking about this but with no success. LOL:
